The Minimax algorithm is a kind of backtracking algorithm that is used in decision making and game theory to find the optimal move for a player, assuming that your opponent also plays optimally. This algorithm can be implemented in any turn-based 2 player game. 
In the algorithm, one player is called the maximizer, and the other player is a minimizer. If we assign an evaluation score to the game board, one player tries to choose a game state with the maximum score, while the other chooses a state with the minimum score.
